# Cross-compiling requires CMake 2.6 or newer. To cross-compile, first modify
# this file to set the proper settings and paths. Then use it from build/ like:
# cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../XCompile.txt \
#          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/mingw32/mingw
# If you already have a toolchain file setup, you may use that instead of this
# file.

# the name of the target operating system
SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)

# which compilers to use for C and C++
SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER arm-gph-linux-gnueabi-gcc)
SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER arm-gph-linux-gnueabi-g++)

# here is the target environment located
SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH /gcc-4.2.4-glibc-2.7-eabi)

# adjust the default behaviour of the FIND_XXX() commands:
# search headers and libraries in the target environment, search 
# programs in the host environment
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
